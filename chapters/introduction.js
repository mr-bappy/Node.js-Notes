/*

what is node.js?
- open-source: source code publicly available
- server-side
- JavaScript runtime environment
- cross-platform: can run on multiple OS without any changes
- runs JavaScript on machine or servers
- built on V8 JS engine 
- robust eco-system with npm packages

why node.js special as runtime?
- uses google chrome's v8 engine compiles JS code into machine code, making it lightning-fast
- comes with built-in APIs, can build powerful applications without extra libraries

why do we need node.js?
- single language for full stack development: JS
- V8 engine
- Event-driven and non-blocking I/O
- scalable for modern apps


question: node.js is language or framework?
- neither both, it is JS runtime environment, where developers can run JS outside browser.
